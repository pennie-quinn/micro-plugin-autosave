# autosave plugin for micro

This repo holds the autosave plugin for micro.

This plugin will let you automatically save on focus lost,
or 5 seconds after your last edit.

Unlike the built-in autosave, this plugin will not write
unchanged buffers.

To install:

```bash
> cd ~/.config/micro/plugins
> git clone https://github.com/pennie-quinn/micro-plugin-autosave.git autosave
```

For documentation, run `> help autosave` in micro's
command prompt. :)
